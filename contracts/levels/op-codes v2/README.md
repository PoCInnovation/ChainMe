# Op-codes v2

## Exploit approached :

The main purpose of this challenge is to discover how op-codes works for etherum, how you can use them and how to read hidden and complex code.

## Goal :

This is a gambling contract where you can MULTIPLY YOUR BET BY 100X, quite amazing right ? Of course there is a trick.
To validate this challenge, you must empty the Wallet contract by taking the whole etherum from it.

## Solution :

To validate this challenge, all you have to do is create a contract with less than 10 op√®codes that needs to return a number you set. Then you need to call setInterface from GuessTheValue contract with the address of the contract you created. Finally, call guess with 0.01 eth as value and a number equal to the one you return in the interface.
