# BadAss

## Exploit approached :

The first challenge named "BadAss" is a challenge using the revert exploit in a receive function. This challenge is inspired by the "King" challenge on Ethernaut and the "King of the Ether" game mechanics.

## Goal :

The BadAss is the person who found the good password and the good amount of ether to send. A the start of the challenge, the BadAss is the person who deployed the contract.
To validate this challenge, the BadAss musn't be the owner, however an additional mechanic is added, the reclaim mechanics. The reclaim is done by the owner
