# ChainMe

## Description

ChaineMe is a project aiming to create a cybersecurity platform with blockchain challenges.

It's not going to be only for Solidity (Etherum's smart contract lnaguage) like most of the others platforms but there is going to be challenges in a wide range of blockchain languages.

Through the challenges, you're going to learn the basics of blockchain's cybersecurity to secure the smart contracts you may have to create.
