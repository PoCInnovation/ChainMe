# ChainMe

## Description

ChaineMe is a project aiming to create a cybersecurity platform with blockchain challenges.

It's not going to be only for Solidity (Etherum's smart contract lnaguage) like most of the others platforms but there is going to be challenges in a wide range of blockchain languages.

Through the challenges, you're going to learn the basics of blockchain's cybersecurity to secure the smart contracts you may have to create.

With this project, we started by learning a lot of general knowledge about P2P / blockchain. Then we learnt how to use IPFS (a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data), Solidity and the main thing was to solve challenges on platforms like Ethernaut and Damn Vulnerable DEFI. Once this was done, we started by creating the challenges.

## Installation

To solve this challenges you need a etherum wallet like metamask.

## Features

It has so far a few solidity's challenges.
